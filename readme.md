After that you must start the server running 

```
npm run server
```

This will run the service and you have to let the terminal window running that process... 
when you finished you can kill the procces by pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>.

In a new temrinal window, open the *front* folder and run 

```
